This protest march began from the Bottola area on the university campus around 2:00 am, early on Thursday. The march travelled various roads on the university campus and then ended going in front the residence of vice-chancellor Mohammad Kamrul Ahsan. At the time students were seen chanting slogans against mob killing, extrajudicial killing and death on campus. Prapti Taposhi, a student of batch 47 at the economics department of the university said, \\u201cA former Chhatra League leader was beaten twice on our campus and died as a result of that. We the students of Jahangirnagar University want to say clearly that we are against any sort of extrajudicial killings.\\u201d \\u2018If anyone has committed a crime, they should be brought to justice according to the state law. But the students of Jahangirnagar University do not support the extrajudicial killing of anyone by beating them to death,\\u201d she added. Earlier on Wednesday afternoon, agitated students beat up Shamim Mollah at a shop adjacent to the Joy Bangla gate of the University. Later he was handed over to the \\u2018proctorial body\\u2019 of the university. At one point, the university administration handed him over to the Ashulia police station members. Later, when he was taken to Gonoshasthaya Samaj Vittik Medical College Hospital at Savar around 9:15 pm in the night, the physician on duty declared him dead.\",\n          \"Disbursement of Indian loans to Bangladesh has slowed down significantly, as only USD 81 million was disbursed in the last seven months (July\\u2013January) under the Indian Line of Credit (LoC). Besides, there has been no fresh commitment for loans. Against the backdrop, an initiative has been undertaken to reassess the projects funded by the LoC, and the process of forming a committee in this regard is underway, according to the economic relations division (ERD). Following the political changeover in August last year, works on multiple India-funded projects came to a standstill. Particularly, the Indian contractor of the Ashuganj-Akhaura four-lane road construction project returned home along with the Indian workers, leading to a four-month halt in the project. There are some more projects where Indian contractors halted or slowed down their works, and the ERD officials described it as the main reason behind the sluggish fund clearance under the LoC. Currently, eight transport and infrastructure projects are ongoing under Indian loans. According to ERD sources, India has disbursed only USD 81.5 million under the LoC between July and January, with no new loan commitments. Professor Mustafizur Rahman, distinguished fellow of the Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD), told Prothom Alo that projects that are essential for the economy should be kept under the LoC. He also advocated for relaxing procurement conditions under the India-funded projects. Since the inception of Indian LoCs in 2010, 2016, and 2017, India has committed a total of USD 7.36 billion in loans to Bangladesh. But its disbursement has been slow, with only USD 1.88 billion disbursed till date. The neighbouring country disbursed an average of more than USD 300 million annually during the last three fiscal years. Among them, USD 311.4 million was cleared in 2023-24 fiscal year, USD 337 million in 2022-23, and USD 329.3 million in 2021-22. Disbursal of loans was significantly slow during the Covid-19 pandemic, as India provided only USD 141.1 million in 2020-21 and USD 148 million in 2019-20. A total of 36 projects in infrastructure sectors, including road and rail connectivity, energy, and road construction, were undertaken under the three Indian LoCs. Of them, 15 have been completed, while eight are ongoing, and 13 are still in the planning or contractor recruitment phase. Both sides, in a LoC review meeting in Dhaka on 5-6 March, reached a consensus over reassessment of the projects. It was learned that a dedicated committee will look into the reasons behind project delays and work towards resolving them.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"newspaper_name\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Prothom Alo\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":8}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# prompt: remove all the news that are berfore 2024-03-01 and aftre 2024-10-15\n","\n","import pandas as pd\n","# Convert the 'Date' column to datetime objects\n","df['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Date'])\n","\n","# Define the start and end dates for the filter\n","start_date = '2024-03-01'\n","end_date = '2024-10-20'\n","\n","# Filter the DataFrame to keep rows within the specified date range\n","df_filtered = df[(df['Date'] >= start_date) & (df['Date'] <= end_date)]\n","\n","# Now df_filtered contains the news within the desired date range\n","df_filtered\n"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":597},"id":"EUnnQuHHpMVU","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1750360297564,"user_tz":-360,"elapsed":408,"user":{"displayName":"Habibur Rashid Akash","userId":"15624672722956474324"}},"outputId":"4e228f8b-bde6-426b-cbbd-0f564a0d605a"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["             Date                                              Title  \\\n","0      2024-09-24  Touhid, top US diplomat Verma discuss peaceful...   \n","1      2024-09-24        Ex-IGP Mamun on 4-day remand in murder case   \n","2      2024-09-24  Touhid, Jaishankar meet at UNGA, discuss mutua...   \n","3      2024-09-24  Army chief pledges support for Yunus' interim ...   \n","4      2024-09-24                 Released top criminals at it again   \n","...           ...                                                ...   \n","139942 2024-10-16  World Cup qualifierVintage Messi nets hat tric...   \n","139943 2024-10-16  Netanyahu vows ‘no ceasefire’ in Lebanon after...   \n","139944 2024-10-16  Italy transfers migrants including Bangladeshi...   \n","139945 2024-10-16  OpinionWhy gender-based violence is worth disc...   \n","139946 2024-10-16  Vegetable MarketLow supply drives price increa...   \n","\n","                                                     Link  \\\n","0       https://www.thedailystar.net/news/bangladesh/d...   \n","1       https://www.thedailystar.net/news/bangladesh/c...   \n","2       https://www.thedailystar.net/news/bangladesh/d...   \n","3       https://www.thedailystar.net/news/bangladesh/n...   \n","4       https://www.thedailystar.net/news/bangladesh/c...   \n","...                                                   ...   \n","139942  https://en.prothomalo.com/sports/football/c0gc...   \n","139943  https://en.prothomalo.com/international/middle...   \n","139944    https://en.prothomalo.com/bangladesh/qlek3uucey   \n","139945  https://en.prothomalo.com/opinion/op-ed/xkaaeq...   \n","139946  https://en.prothomalo.com/business/local/i75uz...   \n","\n","                                                  Details  newspaper_name  \n","0       Foreign Affairs Adviser Touhid Hossain met wit...

The incident occurred around 11:30am. Khalid Monsur, officer-in-charge of Shahbagh Police Station, told The Daily Star that he heard about the incident. He said one group came to protest the cancellation of the two national days, while another obstructed them. However, he was unaware of any assault and the identities of those involved. Kutub Hilali, spokesperson for the Creative Writers Association, which identifies itself as pro-Liberation War writers, said around 11:00am, at least 25 members of their association began preparing for the protest. Upon hearing this, at least 70-80 men arrived at the scene and chased them away. \\\"The group began attacking us just as we were unveiling the banner for the programme. They surrounded me and beat me indiscriminately,\\\" he said. During the altercation, the attackers reportedly assaulted several protesters with sticks. A video of the incident went viral on social media, where the attackers can be heard saying, \\\"Get them! Catch the Awami League members; all of them are running away!\\\" After being beaten up, Soumitra Dev, a poet, said, \\\"I came here today to protest the cancellation of the historic March 7 as a national day. I came here to exercise my freedom of expression, but instead, they beat me.\\\" At that moment, a few plainclothes men were seen attempting to calm the situation.\",\n          \"Chinese Ambassador Yao Wen today held separate meetings with regional leaders of BNP and Jamaat-e-Islami in Chattogram. Adviser to BNP Chairperson Golam Akbar Khandkar along with BNP's regional leaders met the Chinese ambassador while in another meeting Assistant Secretary General of Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami Muhammad Shahjahan along with his party's leaders met the envoy, a Chinese Embassy's press release said. During the discussion, Ambassador Yao emphasised that the Communist Party of China (CPC) has long maintained friendly relations with all major political parties in Bangladesh. He expressed China's willingness to further strengthen exchanges on governance under the new circumstances, enhance personnel training, and promote cooperation across various fields, advancing the Comprehensive Strategic Cooperative Partnership for the benefit of both the people. The regional leaders of the two parties expressed their gratitude for the long-standing support provided by the CPC, the Chinese government and the Chinese people towards Bangladesh's national development, economic and social progress, and the well-being of its people. They noted that Bangladesh is at a critical juncture of national reconstruction and requested continued Chinese support for Bangladesh's development. They also expressed their desire to further strengthen party-to-party exchanges and friendly cooperation with the CPC. Both sides exchanged views on the current situation in celebrating the 50th anniversary of the establishment of China-Bangladesh diplomatic relations in 2025, as well as the \\\"Year of People-to-People Exchanges\\\".\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"newspaper_name\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"The business Standerd\",\n          \"Prothom Alo\",\n          \"The Daily Star\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":5}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["english_df.groupby('newspaper_name').count()"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":206},"id":"qd8hxzDXFX0W","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1750360331589,"user_tz":-360,"elapsed":73,"user":{"displayName":"Habibur Rashid Akash","userId":"15624672722956474324"}},"outputId":"11f9523e-05ef-421d-b472-8bf9b48e52b3"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["                        Date  Title   Link  Details\n","newspaper_name                                     \n","Bangladesh post         6344   6344   6344     6344\n","Prothom Alo             6711   6711   6711     6711\n","The Daily Star         10986  10986  10986    10986\n","The business Standerd  13712  13712  13712    13712"],"text/html":["\n","  <div id=\"df-fe97019a-3549-497c-9a7c-987a6150ae08\" class=\"colab-df-container\">\n","    <div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>Date</th>\n","      <th>Title</th>\n","      <th>Link</th>\n","      <th>Details</th>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>newspaper_name</th>\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th></th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>Bangladesh post</th>\n","      <td>6344</td>\n","      <td>6344</td>\n","      <td>6344</td>\n","      <td>6344</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>Prothom Alo</th>\n","      <td>6711</td>\n","      <td>6711</td>\n","      <td>6711</td>\n","      <td>6711</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>The Daily Star</th>\n","      <td>10986</td>\n","      <td>10986</td>\n","      <td>10986</td>\n","      <td>10986</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>The business Standerd</th>\n","      <td>13712</td>\n","      <td>13712</td>\n","      <td>13712</td>\n","      <td>13712</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","</div>\n","    <div class=\"colab-df-buttons\">\n","\n","  <div class=\"colab-df-container\">\n","    <button class=\"colab-df-convert\" onclick=\"convertToInteractive('df-fe97019a-3549-497c-9a7c-987a6150ae08')\"\n","            title=\"Convert this dataframe to an interactive table.\"\n","            style=\"display:none;\">\n","\n","  <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" height=\"24px\" viewBox=\"0 -960 960 960\">\n","    <path d=\"M120-120v-720h720v720H120Zm60-500h600v-160H180v160Zm220 220h160v-160H400v160Zm0 220h160v-160H400v160ZM180-400h160v-160H180v160Zm440 0h160v-160H620v160ZM180-180h160v-160H180v160Zm440 0h160v-160H620v160Z\"/>\n","  </svg>\n","    </button>\n","\n","  <style>\n","    .colab-df-container {\n","      display:flex;\n","      gap: 12px;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-convert {\n","      background-color: #E8F0FE;\n","      border: none;\n","      border-radius: 50%;\n","      cursor: pointer;\n","      display: none;\n","      fill: #1967D2;\n","      height: 32px;\n","      padding: 0 0 0 0;\n","      width: 32px;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-convert:hover {\n","      background-color: #E2EBFA;\n","      box-shadow: 0px 1px 2px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.3), 0px 1px 3px 1px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.15);\n","      fill: #174EA6;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-buttons div {\n","      margin-bottom: 4px;\n","    }\n","\n","    [theme=dark] .colab-df-convert {\n","      background-color: #3B4455;\n","      fill: #D2E3FC;\n","    }\n","\n","    [theme=dark] .colab-df-convert:hover {\n","      background-color: #434B5C;\n","      box-shadow: 0px 1px 3px 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);\n","      filter: drop-shadow(0px 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3));\n","      fill: #FFFFFF;\n","    }\n","  </style>\n","\n","    <script>\n","      const buttonEl =\n","        document.querySelector('#df-fe97019a-3549-497c-9a7c-987a6150ae08 button.colab-df-convert');\n","      buttonEl.style.display =\n","        google.colab.kernel.accessAllowed ?

He made the observation when asked about the US-China competition, especially the US's Indo-Pacific Strategy and China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). \\\"We haven't stated any loud and clear position on any of this. We are observing what's going on,\\\" he said at the 'DCAB Talk' organized by the Diplomatic Correspondents Association, Bangladesh (DCAB) at the National Press Club. \\\"When the powers are in action, they are doing their game. It has consequences. This is my personal view,\\\" Paulo Fenando said. \\\"Everything will depend on how the relationship (of the US) with China evolves. You know, people keep talking about the possible war between the United States and China. I hope they don't get there, because if they do, it's going to be a nasty one,\\\" he said. There are many forces to counter this sort of confrontation, and the United States has its problems right now, and China also has problems right now. Asked about the Rohingya crisis, he said the Rohingya situation could worsen if not addressed fast. \\\"And the solution for the Rohingya is that they should return to Myanmar as soon as the situation allows,\\\" he said He asked all to keep the Rohingya issue alive. \\\"We kept it [Rohingya] under the attention of the Security Council when we presided over it. We said, this is important for them. So don't drop it, don't let it go away,\\\" the ambassador said. \\\"It's a problem that the international community should address. We should help Bangladesh until this is solved. They have to be repatriated,\\\" he said. \\\"When the situation normalises, I think that all the help you are giving them, it adds to the country's credentials,\\\" he said. Brazil offered Bangladesh to buy ethanol as a source of green fuel to reduce dependence on fossil fuels and promote environmental sustainability. Brazilian Ambassador Paulo Fernando Dias Feres has said that it is \\\"possible\\\" to get live cattle from Brazil, but the process is \\\"complicated\\\". He offered meat and other support to develop the industry in Bangladesh. DCAB President Nurul Islam Hasib and General Secretary Ashiqur Rahman Apu also spoke.\",\n          \"A group of Dhaka University students today brought out a torch procession in response to the killing of Bangladeshi teenager Jayanta Kumar Singha, 14, by BSF forces along Kantivita border in Thakurgaon's Baliadangi upazila. The procession began at TSC and concluded with a rally in front of the Raju Sculpture. Readus Salehin Jawad, a student of the economics department, led the rally. Rajekuzzaman Jewel from the television and film department said, \\\"Just two days after the murder of Swarna Das, there has been another killing at the border. We repeatedly find ourselves standing against Indian aggression because successive Bangladeshi governments had similar foreign policies towards India. It is crucial for everyone to unite against all forms of imperialistic aggression.\\\" Muhammad Mustakim, from economics department said, \\\"With the fall of the pro-India Awami government, students dreamt of a new Bangladesh. However, ongoing Indian water terrorism and the regular killing of Bangladeshi citizens at the border indicate that Bangladesh still follows a submissive foreign policy towards India. We demand that the interim government take a firm stance against Indian aggression and fight these incidents according to international law.\\\" Fatin Ishraque of the physics department said, \\\"We want to tell the interim government that if you are indeed a government of the people, elected through a popular uprising, you must take action on this issue. The border killings are violations of international human rights law. Under this law, you must hold the Indian government and the BSF accountable. You have the Indian Embassy in your country; you need to demand accountability from them and give an ultimatum.

He made the observation when asked about the US-China competition, especially the US's Indo-Pacific Strategy and China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). \\\"We haven't stated any loud and clear position on any of this. We are observing what's going on,\\\" he said at the 'DCAB Talk' organized by the Diplomatic Correspondents Association, Bangladesh (DCAB) at the National Press Club. \\\"When the powers are in action, they are doing their game. It has consequences. This is my personal view,\\\" Paulo Fenando said. \\\"Everything will depend on how the relationship (of the US) with China evolves. You know, people keep talking about the possible war between the United States and China. I hope they don't get there, because if they do, it's going to be a nasty one,\\\" he said. There are many forces to counter this sort of confrontation, and the United States has its problems right now, and China also has problems right now. Asked about the Rohingya crisis, he said the Rohingya situation could worsen if not addressed fast. \\\"And the solution for the Rohingya is that they should return to Myanmar as soon as the situation allows,\\\" he said He asked all to keep the Rohingya issue alive. \\\"We kept it [Rohingya] under the attention of the Security Council when we presided over it. We said, this is important for them. So don't drop it, don't let it go away,\\\" the ambassador said. \\\"It's a problem that the international community should address. We should help Bangladesh until this is solved. They have to be repatriated,\\\" he said. \\\"When the situation normalises, I think that all the help you are giving them, it adds to the country's credentials,\\\" he said. Brazil offered Bangladesh to buy ethanol as a source of green fuel to reduce dependence on fossil fuels and promote environmental sustainability. Brazilian Ambassador Paulo Fernando Dias Feres has said that it is \\\"possible\\\" to get live cattle from Brazil, but the process is \\\"complicated\\\". He offered meat and other support to develop the industry in Bangladesh. DCAB President Nurul Islam Hasib and General Secretary Ashiqur Rahman Apu also spoke.\",\n          \"A group of Dhaka University students today brought out a torch procession in response to the killing of Bangladeshi teenager Jayanta Kumar Singha, 14, by BSF forces along Kantivita border in Thakurgaon's Baliadangi upazila. The procession began at TSC and concluded with a rally in front of the Raju Sculpture. Readus Salehin Jawad, a student of the economics department, led the rally. Rajekuzzaman Jewel from the television and film department said, \\\"Just two days after the murder of Swarna Das, there has been another killing at the border. We repeatedly find ourselves standing against Indian aggression because successive Bangladeshi governments had similar foreign policies towards India. It is crucial for everyone to unite against all forms of imperialistic aggression.\\\" Muhammad Mustakim, from economics department said, \\\"With the fall of the pro-India Awami government, students dreamt of a new Bangladesh. However, ongoing Indian water terrorism and the regular killing of Bangladeshi citizens at the border indicate that Bangladesh still follows a submissive foreign policy towards India. We demand that the interim government take a firm stance against Indian aggression and fight these incidents according to international law.\\\" Fatin Ishraque of the physics department said, \\\"We want to tell the interim government that if you are indeed a government of the people, elected through a popular uprising, you must take action on this issue. The border killings are violations of international human rights law. Under this law, you must hold the Indian government and the BSF accountable. You have the Indian Embassy in your country; you need to demand accountability from them and give an ultimatum.

He made the observation when asked about the US-China competition, especially the US's Indo-Pacific Strategy and China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). \\\"We haven't stated any loud and clear position on any of this. We are observing what's going on,\\\" he said at the 'DCAB Talk' organized by the Diplomatic Correspondents Association, Bangladesh (DCAB) at the National Press Club. \\\"When the powers are in action, they are doing their game. It has consequences. This is my personal view,\\\" Paulo Fenando said. \\\"Everything will depend on how the relationship (of the US) with China evolves. You know, people keep talking about the possible war between the United States and China. I hope they don't get there, because if they do, it's going to be a nasty one,\\\" he said. There are many forces to counter this sort of confrontation, and the United States has its problems right now, and China also has problems right now. Asked about the Rohingya crisis, he said the Rohingya situation could worsen if not addressed fast. \\\"And the solution for the Rohingya is that they should return to Myanmar as soon as the situation allows,\\\" he said He asked all to keep the Rohingya issue alive. \\\"We kept it [Rohingya] under the attention of the Security Council when we presided over it. We said, this is important for them. So don't drop it, don't let it go away,\\\" the ambassador said. \\\"It's a problem that the international community should address. We should help Bangladesh until this is solved. They have to be repatriated,\\\" he said. \\\"When the situation normalises, I think that all the help you are giving them, it adds to the country's credentials,\\\" he said. Brazil offered Bangladesh to buy ethanol as a source of green fuel to reduce dependence on fossil fuels and promote environmental sustainability. Brazilian Ambassador Paulo Fernando Dias Feres has said that it is \\\"possible\\\" to get live cattle from Brazil, but the process is \\\"complicated\\\". He offered meat and other support to develop the industry in Bangladesh. DCAB President Nurul Islam Hasib and General Secretary Ashiqur Rahman Apu also spoke.\",\n          \"A group of Dhaka University students today brought out a torch procession in response to the killing of Bangladeshi teenager Jayanta Kumar Singha, 14, by BSF forces along Kantivita border in Thakurgaon's Baliadangi upazila. The procession began at TSC and concluded with a rally in front of the Raju Sculpture. Readus Salehin Jawad, a student of the economics department, led the rally. Rajekuzzaman Jewel from the television and film department said, \\\"Just two days after the murder of Swarna Das, there has been another killing at the border. We repeatedly find ourselves standing against Indian aggression because successive Bangladeshi governments had similar foreign policies towards India. It is crucial for everyone to unite against all forms of imperialistic aggression.\\\" Muhammad Mustakim, from economics department said, \\\"With the fall of the pro-India Awami government, students dreamt of a new Bangladesh. However, ongoing Indian water terrorism and the regular killing of Bangladeshi citizens at the border indicate that Bangladesh still follows a submissive foreign policy towards India. We demand that the interim government take a firm stance against Indian aggression and fight these incidents according to international law.\\\" Fatin Ishraque of the physics department said, \\\"We want to tell the interim government that if you are indeed a government of the people, elected through a popular uprising, you must take action on this issue. The border killings are violations of international human rights law. Under this law, you must hold the Indian government and the BSF accountable. You have the Indian Embassy in your country; you need to demand accountability from them and give an ultimatum. We urge the people to stay on the streets and continue the struggle against Indian imperialism.\\\" Saifulah Saif of the Japanese Studies Department also spoke at the rally, with the concluding

News of the launches rattled US and European traders and sparked a sell-off on most markets, though Asia fared slightly better, with Hong Kong jumping more than six percent as it reopened after a one-day break. Both main crude contracts shot up more than five percent at one point Tuesday after Iran fired dozens of missiles at Israel in response to the killings of Tehran-backed militant leaders. While most were intercepted by air defences before reaching their targets, the move sparked a stern response from Israel and the United States, with Washington saying it was discussing a joint response and warning of \\u201csevere consequences\\u201d. Israel vowed it would make Iran \\u201cpay\\u201d for the launch, while Tehran threatened to hit all Israeli infrastructure if attacked. \\u201cThe burning question is whether Iran\\u2019s missile strike is a one-off response or the start of something much bigger. Most bets lean towards the former, especially with the US stepping in to back Israel,\\u201d said independent analyst Stephen Innes. \\u201cIran\\u2019s oil infrastructure could very well be in their crosshairs. Taking a swing at Iran\\u2019s oil lifeline could have far-reaching economic consequences, sparking a severe escalation,\\u201d Innes wrote in his The Dark Side Of The Boom newsletter. Demand for gold\\u2014considered a go-to in times of uncertainty and turmoil\\u2014pushed the precious metal close to its $2,685 record. All three main indexes on Wall Street ended in the red, with the Nasdaq down more than one percent. But Asia fared a little better. Hong Kong briefly soared more than six percent\\u2014and passed 22,000 points for the first time since February last year\\u2014as traders returned from a one-day break to resume buying beaten-down stocks after China last week began unveiling a raft of economic stimulus measures. The Hang Seng Index has rocketed more than 20 percent over the past seven trading sessions on optimism that Beijing will press on with its stimulus campaign, with developers leading the charge higher as officials target the property sector. Among the measures China has unveiled are interest rate cuts, an easing of home-buying rules and a cut to banks\\u2019 reserve requirement ratio\\u2014the amount of cash they must hold in reserve\\u2014allowing them to lend more. Markets were closed in Shanghai and Shenzhen for a week-long holiday, having also zoomed higher before the break. The continued rally in Hong Kong \\u201cseems to show that both local and foreign investors remain optimistic about this rebound and that the short-term rally might be sustained\\u201d, Kenny Ng, a strategist at Everbright Securities International, told AFP. He warned of a short-term pullback owing to the pace of recent gains, but added: \\u201cThe strength and comprehensiveness of the central government\\u2019s stimulus this time were beyond expectations. \\u201cThe cuts to the interest rate and the reserve requirement ratio went beyond the minimum, and the policies were wide-ranging, not only monetary policy but also policies on the property market and capital markets.\\u201d There were also gains in Singapore and Manila But Tokyo fell more than two percent, continuing its volatile run after tanking Monday on a strong yen in reaction to Shigeru Ishiba\\u2019s election as head of Japan\\u2019s ruling party. Ishiba, sworn in as prime minister Tuesday, has said he backs the central bank\\u2019s interest rate hikes and was also eyeing possible corporate tax increases. Dealers are also awaiting the release of key US jobs data at the end of the week, hoping for a fresh idea about the state of the economy and the Federal Reserve\\u2019s plans for borrowing costs after last month\\u2019s bumper cut.\",\n          \"When powers are in action, they are doing their game which has consequences, said Brazilian Ambassador to Bangladesh Paulo Fernando Dias Feres today. He made the observation when asked about the US-China competition, especially the US's Indo-Pacific Strategy and China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). \\\"We haven't stated any loud and clear position on any of this. We are observing what's going on,\\\" he said at the 'DCAB Talk' organized by the Diplomatic Correspondents Association, Bangladesh (DCAB) at the National Press Club. \\\"When the powers are in action, they are doing their game. It has consequences. This is my personal view,\\\" Paulo Fenando said. \\\"Everything will depend on how the relationship (of the US) with China evolves. You know, people keep talking about the possible war between the United States and China. I hope they don't get there, because if they do, it's going to be a nasty one,\\\" he said. There are many forces to counter this sort of confrontation, and the United States has its problems right now, and China also has problems right now. Asked about the Rohingya crisis, he said the Rohingya situation could worsen if not addressed fast. \\\"And the solution for the Rohingya is that they should return to Myanmar as soon as the situation allows,\\\" he said He asked all to keep the Rohingya issue alive. \\\"We kept it [Rohingya] under the attention of the Security Council when we presided over it. We said, this is important for them. So don't drop it, don't let it go away,\\\" the ambassador said. \\\"It's a problem that the international community should address. We should help Bangladesh until this is solved. They have to be repatriated,\\\" he said. \\\"When the situation normalises, I think that all the help you are giving them, it adds to the country's credentials,\\\" he said. Brazil offered Bangladesh to buy ethanol as a source of green fuel to reduce dependence on fossil fuels and promote environmental sustainability. Brazilian Ambassador Paulo Fernando Dias Feres has said that it is \\\"possible\\\" to get live cattle from Brazil, but the process is \\\"complicated\\\". He offered meat and other support to develop the industry in Bangladesh. DCAB President Nurul Islam Hasib and General Secretary Ashiqur Rahman Apu also spoke.\",\n          \"Nepal to secure a place in the Super Eights stage of the T20 World Cup after struggling against an effervescent bowling attack. A victory for Bangladesh would earn them the final spot in the Super Eights stage, in Group 1 along with Afghanistan, Australia and India. A defeat would open the door to the Netherlands who face Sri Lanka in St.Lucia later on Sunday. If Bangladesh lose and the Netherlands win, the Dutch would go through only if they can also improve their run-rate over the Bangladeshis. Nepal were on top from the outset with seamer Sompal Kami dismissing Tanzid Hasan with the first ball of the innings. Tanzid inexplicably chose to dance down the track to the first ball and mis-timed his attempted pull shot which produced a simple caught and bowled for Sompal. Bangladesh captain Najmul Hossain Shanto then went in the second over, clean bowled by spinner Dipendra Singh Airee. Nepal skipper Rohit Paudel stuck with the excellent Sompal Kami for a third over in his opening spell and was rewarded when he claimed the crucial wicket of Litton Das. The track offered plenty of turn for the spinners and Bangladesh struggled to find any sort of momentum, finding themselves and when Sandeep Lamichhane bowled Jaker Ali with a superb googly, Bangladesh were 75-8 in the 16th over. Rishad Hossain opted to go on the attack and hit a six and four as he made 13 off seven balls but the final pairing of Mustafizur Rahman and Taskin Ahmed managed to put on 18 and get the total into three figures before Mustafizur was run-out in the final over.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\":
